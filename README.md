# noisecat :smirk_cat:
The noise swiss army knife

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gedigi/noisecat)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gedigi/noisecat) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gedigi/noisecat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gedigi/noisecat)

noisecat :smirk_cat: is a featured networking utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using the [Noise Protocol Framework](http://noiseprotocol.org) (and TCP/IP).

## Download and build
Just `git clone` it, fetch dependencies using `go get github.com/gedigi/noise/...`, `make` it and you'll have binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Usage
This is how `noisecat -h` looks like:

    Usage: noisecat [options] [address] [port]

    Options:
      -e command
          Executes the given command
      -k	accepts multiple connections (-l && (-e || -proxy) required)
      -l	listens for incoming connections
      -p port
          source port to use
      -proto protocol name
          protocol name to use (default "Noise_NN_25519_AESGCM_SHA256")
      -proxy address:port
          address:port combination to forward connections to (-l required)
      -psk pre-shared key
          pre-shared key to use (max 32 bytes)
      -rstatic static key
          static key of the remote peer (32 bytes, hex-encoded)
      -s address
          source address to use
      -v  more verbose output

    Protocol name format: Noise_PT_DH_CP_HS

    Where:
      PT: Handshake pattern
      DH: Diffie-Helman handshake function
      CP: Cipher function
      HS: Hash function

      e.g. Noise_NN_25519_AESGCM_SHA256

    Available handshake patterns:
      NN, NK, NX, XX, IX
      XN, IN, XK, IK

    Available DH functions:
      25519

    Available Cipher functions:
      AESGCM, ChaChaPoly

    Available Hash functions:
      SHA256, SHA512, BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s

The flags are similar to the traditional netcat. In short:
* `-l -p 31337` listens on port 31337/tcp
* `-e /bin/sh` executes /bin/sh (reverse shell anyone?)

The main difference is the Noise Protocol-related flags:
* `-proto` sets the Noise Protocol name that you want to use
* `-psk` sets a pre-shared key, known to both client and server, used to authenticate a handshake
* `-rstatic` specifies the remote peer static (public) key, used in "K"-type handshakes

Other features are:
* `-proxy` allows to create a tunnel `client -noise-> server -tcp-> final endpoint`
* `-k` accepts multiple connections (like ncat)

## TODO
- [x] write some tests
- [x] add Makefile
- [ ] add a static key validator helper function
- [ ] add new features (suggestions are welcome, pull requests too!)
